# Hospital Management System Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

This security assessment evaluates the Hospital Management System (HMS) against healthcare industry security standards and compliance requirements. The assessment reveals a system with foundational security measures in place but significant gaps that must be addressed to achieve enterprise-grade security and full compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Current Security Posture

### Strengths
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation with TOTP
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- Data encryption service using AES-256-GCM
- Compliance monitoring framework for HIPAA and GDPR
- Audit logging capabilities
- Network segmentation with Kubernetes Network Policies
- Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Areas of Concern
- Hardcoded secrets in configuration files
- Missing security headers in main application
- Inadequate input validation on some endpoints
- No certificate pinning for mobile applications
- Limited security monitoring and alerting
- No automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Missing data loss prevention (DLP) controls

## Detailed Security Analysis

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

**Current Implementation:**
- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Passport.js with local and JWT strategies
- MFA with TOTP using speakeasy library
- RBAC implementation with Casbin for fine-grained permissions
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (15-minute lockout)

**Security Gaps:**
- JWT secret validation not robust enough
- No refresh token rotation
- Missing OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect integration
- No adaptive authentication based on risk
- Password policy not enforced (length, complexity, history)

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement OAuth 2.0/OIDC with Keycloak (already configured but not integrated)
2. Add refresh token rotation
3. Implement risk-based authentication
4. Enforce strong password policies
5. Add session management with revocation capabilities

### 2. Data Protection

**Current Implementation:**
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- Encryption service for field-level encryption
- File encryption capabilities

**Security Gaps:**
- Encryption key management not secure (keys in environment variables)
- No hardware security module (HSM) integration
- Missing database column-level encryption
- No data masking for display purposes
- Backup encryption not verified

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement proper key management with HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS
2. Add database column-level encryption for PHI
3. Implement data masking for display
4. Verify backup encryption integrity
5. Add HSM integration for key protection
